# Winter (I like snow, that's why)
 A simple weather app fetching its data from OpenWeatherMap's API. It has been created while following The Odin Project. Its purpose was to manipulate asynchronous JavaScript and fetch data from an API.


Some info (no particular order):

- It is fully responsive! (It's the first project I designed 'mobile-first')
- You can (if you tap/click on the main temperature) see the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit!
- The background changes accordingly to the weather (not all weathers are supported, if not supported, it'll default to a starry sky).
- Simple UI
- Dark mode

See it [live on GitHub Pages](https://bussun.github.io/winter)!

## Issues
- On PC, when resizing the window, there is sometimes a white bar at the bottom. I know the reason why but haven't found a solution.
